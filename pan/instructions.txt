Need openCV to build the cpp file
to run command is:
./pano "path to image 1" "path to image 2" ...
will output the stitched image as stitch.jpg
code based off code from http://study.marearts.com/2013/11/opencv-stitching-example-stitcher-class.html
can also get images to stitch together from that website
