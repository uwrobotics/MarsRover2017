    <!--
        This launchfile expects two virtual can interfaces, vcan0 and vcan1. One node sends messages received
        on vcan0 to the ros topic received_messages, another node passes the messages received here to vcan1.

        With the can-utils tools you can then use:
            cangen vcan0

        to create random frames on vcan0 and:
            candump vcan0 vcan1

        to show data from both busses to see that the messages end up on vcan1 as well.
